# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## BLE Advertiser (optional helper)

If you want mobile browsers to discover your laptop as an Admin device, you can run a small advertiser on the laptop (it makes the laptop appear as `POS-Admin` and advertise the app's SERVICE UUID so `requestDevice()` can find it).

1. Install the advertiser dependency inside `pos-admin`:

   ```bash
   cd pos-admin
   npm install @abandonware/bleno
   ```

2. Run the advertiser:

   ```bash
   npm run ble-advertise
   ```

3. Open your mobile device (on the same Wi-Fi network) and open the User UI. Open the Bluetooth modal and click **Scan / Pick Device** — you should see **POS-Admin** in the system chooser.

Notes and caveats:
- `@abandonware/bleno` is the community-maintained fork and works best on Linux/macOS. On Windows you may need extra drivers and build tools (Windows support is limited).
- If the advertiser reports `state !== 'poweredOn'` check that your laptop's Bluetooth is enabled and the adapter is supported.
- For mobile Web Bluetooth to work reliably you should serve the User app over HTTPS on the phone (see README below for options like ngrok).
